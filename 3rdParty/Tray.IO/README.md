Tray.IO can listen for a webhook payload and perform an action.

### Quick Start
Tray.IO has [comprehensive documenation](https://tray.io/documentation/connectors/service/arcgis/) for ArcGIS Online Feature Services. Their ready to go ArcGIS connector will automatically create a webhook on the given Hosted Feature Service. After setting up the connection, it's simply a matter of completing your workflow. The [example provided](https://tray.io/documentation/connectors/service/arcgis/#example-usage) by Tray.IO demonstrates how the service could apply an edit to a hosted service.
